## Overview
This repository contains Python code for visualizing survey responses regarding the likelihood of checking weather on a smartwatch, segmented by age group and US region. The dataset includes responses on a Likert scale.

### Visualization 1: Likelihood of Checking Weather on Smartwatch by Age Group
**Description**: Horizontal bar chart showing the likelihood of checking weather on a smartwatch by age group.
**Features**:
- Segmented bars representing different likelihood categories.
- Absolute response numbers displayed on the bars.
- Age groups as y-axis labels.
**Color Scheme**: Custom colors (#d9d696, #d996b8, #a096d9, #96c1d9) used for different likelihood categories.
**Styling**:
- Axes and legend text color set to #38383b for consistency.
- Grid lines removed.

### Visualization 2: Likelihood of Checking Weather on Smartwatch by US Region
**Description**: Horizontal bar chart illustrating the likelihood of checking weather on a smartwatch by US region.
**Features**:
- Stacked bars for each US region, representing different likelihood categories.
- Absolute response numbers displayed near the top of each bar.
- US regions as y-axis labels.
**Color Scheme**: Custom colors (#d9d696, #d996b8, #a096d9, #96c1d9) used for different likelihood categories.
**Styling**:
- Axes and legend text color set to #38383b for consistency.
- Grid lines removed.

### Visualization 3: Age Group Preferences for Smartwatch Weather Checking (Absolute Values)
**Description**: Stacked bar chart illustrating the absolute number of responses for each likelihood category of smartwatch weather checking within different age groups. Each bar stack represents the total count of responses for each age group.
**Styling**:
- Axes and legend text color set to #38383b for consistency.
- Grid lines removed.

### Visualization 4: US Region Preferences for Smartwatch Weather Checking (Absolute Values)
**Description**: Stacked bar chart showing the absolute number of responses for each likelihood category of smartwatch weather checking within different US regions. Each bar stack represents the total count of responses for each region.
**Styling**:
- Axes and legend text color set to #38383b for consistency.
- Grid lines removed.


## How to Use
1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, matplotlib).
2. Copy the provided Python code into your project or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Replace the 'data' variable with your dataset containing survey responses.
4. Run the code to generate the visualizations.
